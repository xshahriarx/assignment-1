            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p class="black-colour">I love to cook, but I haven’t always. In fact, for most of my early adult life,
                cooking dinner
                usually meant microwaving a frozen dinner or adding boiling water to something that came from a box.
                It wasn’t until I got married that I started eating real food because I married a guy who cooks. I
                started joining him in the kitchen and realized that cooking could be fun. </p>

            <h2>My Recipies</h2>
            <p>They are usually quick and simple mostly seasonal<br> and always delicious. I hope you enjoy them as
                much<br> as my family and I do. these sound like the kind of recipe<br> ideas you are looking for, then
                head on in…</p>

                <h2>Breakfast Bowl</h2>
                <p>It has a fairly decent flavor, though it's kind of dry and chalky, which makes it unpleasant to eat.
                    It tends to crumble up, which means it's pretty tricky to get a bite that doesn't have any egg in
                    it.</p>

                <h2>Korean Ramen</h2>
                <p>Like most noodle producers, best-selling Korean brand NongShim makes many varieties. But of the few I
                    tried, the Spicy Pot-au-feu Flavor was the best. </p>

                <h2>Thai Soup</h2>
                <p>I enjoy trying new soups, and Campbell's has a hit here with this one. Thai chicken is one of my
                    faves, and this does a decent job giving you a more flavourful chicken soup.</p>
